qcgs.py

Python script for calling Q-Chem via growing string. The name of
this script is actually hardcoded into gstring.exe. 

This is not too complicated, I hope - this script, which pretends to
be the Q-Chem executable, creates a QChem() object and then calls
Q-Chem that way.

The motivation is that I want to prevent HF/KS unstable states from
entering the growing string calculation.  However, these states
are quite rare, and the stability analysis is expensive.  So my
compromise solution is to do a stability analysis every 10 string
iterations, or for any image that was unstable for the previous
string iteration.

Also, this script ensures that every image in the growing string calculation
uses the Q-Chem
